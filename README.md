Here you can find the code file and a sample .JSON file with sample dataset that I used to evaluate the effectiveness of three different TTS models in Tajik language.

- Here is the link to the spreadsheet used during data collection and analysis: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ms2YohiBr-rdYrssjZE-zTCg1Xg0k2sYyiwOTx_WcK0/edit?usp=sharing. 
- For subjective metrics, a Google Form was created and sent to Tajik speaker groups on social media. Around 25 people fully completed the form, and their results were summarized. All the metrics were scored on a scale of 0 to 5: 0 = very poor quality, 5 = excellent quality. Visit the following link to have a look at the Google Form and feel free to complete it: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAVYZHpuY5ruzxVsR83W4UxDIlIN_tiQdojsmAtR4NrTYqeA/viewform
